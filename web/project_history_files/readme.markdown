# Automatic Generated Files - Do Not Edit

This repository contains files that are automatically generated by a program or a script. These files are dynamically generated based on specific configurations and should not be manually modified. Any changes made to these files may be overwritten the next time the generator script is executed.

## Usage

To use the generated files, follow these steps:

1. Eel
2. check out the handle_project_files.py

### Step 1 - Ensure Dependencies

Ensure that the necessary dependencies and tools are set up in your development environment. This may include:

- [Eel]

### Step 2 - Generate Files

To generate the files, [provide instructions on how to run the generator script or program]. This will initiate the process of generating the necessary files based on the predefined configurations.

## Important Note

Do not manually edit any files marked as "automatically generated". Any changes made to these files directly will be overwritten the next time the generation process is run.

If you need to customize the generated output, refer to the [instructions on customizing configurations] in the respective script or program.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the generated files or the generation process, please [contact the project maintainers or contributors].
